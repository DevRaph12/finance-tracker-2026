## ♿ Accessibility Focused (a11y)

In this project, a core focus was placed on making financial management inclusive for everyone:
- **Semantic HTML:** Used proper document structure (tags like `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<label>`) to ensure screen readers can navigate effectively.
- **Dynamic ARIA Labels:** Implementation of `aria-live="polite"` on the total balance to notify assistive technologies of value changes without interrupting the user.
- **Inclusive UI:** Every interactive icon (like the delete button or theme switcher) includes descriptive `title` and `aria-label` attributes that translate dynamically with the selected language.
- **Contrast & Visibility:** Color palettes were chosen to maintain high contrast ratios in both Light and Dark modes.

## 🧠 Technical Learnings

Developing this v1.0 version provided deep insights into:
1. **Advanced DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically updating UI components based on complex financial logic.
2. **State Management:** Handling local data arrays and keeping them synchronized with the UI and LocalStorage.
3. **CSS Architecture:** Utilizing CSS Variables (Custom Properties) to create a robust, scalable theme system.
4. **I18n Logic:** Implementing a custom translation engine that preserves icons and accessibility metadata.
